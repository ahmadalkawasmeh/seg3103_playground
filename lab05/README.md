## Summary
Below I've attached screenshots of the working website for the elixir grade, and for the successful twitter tests. I have implemented the 4 missing test cases using mock objects. For the grade website, Iâ€™ve stubbed the 3 values for the grades while avoiding to actually implement the calculator.
